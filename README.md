### Background and Research Questions:
- The open source [CMS (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services) Inpatient data](https://data.cms.gov/provider-summary-by-type-of-service/medicare-inpatient-hospitals/medicare-inpatient-hospitals-by-provider) provides information on hospital discharges from Original Medicare (fee-for-service) Part A (Hospital Insurance) beneficiaries by Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS) hospitals. It includes information on the use, payment, and hospital charges for more than 3,000 U.S. hospitals that received IPPS payments.
- The Research Questions are: 
    - **What factors captured in the data may account for higher payments?**
    - **What factors may account for more (or less) Medicare coverage for payments?**
    - **What payments/coverage can we predict for the next year (i.e., 2022, as the data's timeframe is 2017-2021)?**

### Statement of Business Task:
- The business task is to find factors associated with payments, medicare coverage, and predict the next year's payments. This exploratory analysis will be an investigation into what providers and diagnosis-related groupings are associated with payments and coverage. Further, using what is found about the payments, those factors can be used to predict what payments/coverage might be expected in 2022 based on the prior five years' data.
