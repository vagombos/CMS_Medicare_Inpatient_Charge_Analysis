### Background and Research Questions:
- The open source [CMS (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services) Inpatient data](https://data.cms.gov/provider-summary-by-type-of-service/medicare-inpatient-hospitals/medicare-inpatient-hospitals-by-provider) provides information on hospital discharges from Original Medicare (fee-for-service) Part A (Hospital Insurance) beneficiaries by Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS) hospitals. It includes information on the use, payment, and hospital charges for more than 3,000 U.S. hospitals that received IPPS payments.
- The Research Questions are: 
    - **What factors captured in the data may account for higher payments?**
    - **What factors may account for more (or less) Medicare coverage for payments?**
    - **What payments/coverage can we predict for the next year (i.e., 2022, as the data's timeframe is 2017-2021)?**

### Statement of Business Task:
- The business task is to find factors associated with payments, medicare coverage, and predict the next year's payments. This exploratory analysis will be an investigation into what providers and diagnosis-related groupings are associated with payments and coverage. Further, using what is found about the payments, those factors can be used to predict what payments/coverage might be expected in 2022 based on the prior five years' data.
- Key factors have been established in the literature on medical costs that point to especially good prospects in the dataset to investigate, thus giving clearer direction on what to focus on:
1. The **type of diagnosis/condition of patients** is a driver for medical costs--especially chronic ones.[^1]
2. The **number of discharges or volume of services** by providers is related to medical costs. [^2]
3. The **types of providers/hospitals** have a relationship to Medicare costs.[^3],[^4]
